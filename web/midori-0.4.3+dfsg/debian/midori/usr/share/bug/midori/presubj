Sometimes a problem in Midori is caused by a bug in the rendering
engine, Webkit.  Please take a moment to try to reproduce bugs with
the Webkit test browser, /usr/lib/webkitgtk-1.0-0/libexec/GtkLauncher.
If you are able to reproduce your bug in the Webkit test browser,
report the bug against libwebkitgtk-1.0-0 instead. You may also wish
to see if your bug has already been reported as a webkit bug:
